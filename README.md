# selene
Selene is a selenium loader built in python3 with PyQt5 as the GUI.

# use
Click Start.bat in Windows to launch, or run gui.py from the command line in your OS of choice. 

# how 
Load a .csv that follows the rules mentioned in the documentation. You can then easily build selenium routines with the interface se.py and add to it with relative ease.
This allows you to customize and focus on the testing/automation and not typing enormous amounts of loops/methods.
