# selene
Selene is a selenium loader built in python3 with PyQt5 as the GUI.

# use
run install.bat:

1. it will install python 3.6 (program language), selenium (automation), pandas (data management), and PyQT (user interface). Lastly, will attempt to insert 'C:\selene-master\' into your PATH var. You don't need to move it to that location unless you want to launch from command prompt with "selene".
 
2. then run StartSelene.vbs or use "selene" from command prompt to use it.

# how 
Load a .csv that follows the rules mentioned in the header of any example you find in instructions/*.csv. You can then easily build selenium routines with the interface se.py and add to it with relative ease.
This allows you to customize and focus on the testing/automation and not typing enormous amounts of loops/methods.
