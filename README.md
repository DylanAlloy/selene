# selene
Selene is a selenium loader built in python3 with PyQt5 as the GUI.

# use
run install.bat:

1. it will install python 3.6 (program language), selenium (automation), pandas (data management), and PyQT (user interface).
 
2. then run StartSelene.vbs

# how 
Load a .csv that follows the rules mentioned in the header of any example you find in instructions/*.csv. You can then easily build selenium routines with the interface se.py and add to it with relative ease.
This allows you to customize and focus on the testing/automation and not typing enormous amounts of loops/methods. 

# extra because I'm always extra
I highly recommend Anaconda/Spyder with python 3.5 or even 3.6. After that, do a simple "conda install -c clinicalgraphics selenium" in your command line, run my program, and you're good to go. You'll also have most, if not all, of the scientific libraries you could need for your environment so don't complain if the installation takes a good amount of time. No, they are not paying me.
